# DrawToMars
Takes an image as input, detects triangles and circles using OpenCV, and creates a minigame based on the original image.
## How it works:
+ Triangles turn into asteroids and planets. The size of the shape determines the size and speed of the in-game object. They damage the car. 
+ Circles turn into wormholes. They can teleport the car to different wormholes randomly.
